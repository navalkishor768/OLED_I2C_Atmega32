# OLED_I2C_Atmega32
Interfacing OLED with Atmega32 Baremetal

I have started working on interfacing OLED using I2C communication.
Purpose of this project is to overcome Arduino limitation.
In baremetal we can configure Atmega32 as per our desired clock, internal or external oscillator.
We can use PWM as per own set frequecny.
